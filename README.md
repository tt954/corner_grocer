# Corner Grocer

## About

This C++/Python application processes a record list of items purchased in a given day at the grocery store. User can choose from the following menu:

1. Produce a list of all items purchased and their frequencies listed alphabetically
2. Search for a specific item to see how many times that item was purchased (appeared in the record list)
3. Produce a text-based histogram of all items purchased and their frequencies in a given a day

## Challenges

- Folder structure - There was some difficulty with reading the input file at the beginning because it was placed in the wrong directory. It is important to include necessary files in the correct folder.

## Improvements

- This program could be expanded further to include additional functionalities such as listing the items by most to least frequently purchased. Furthermore, the program could ask the user to enter a string to represent the input file they want to process (list of items of a different day).
- Right now, the search functionality is case insensitive and exact match. Regular expression can be used to implement partial match.

## Moving forward

- Using the two languages together allowed me to see the strengths of each language as well as widen my knowledge for each of them.
- The [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) was a helpful resource for providing a comprehensive list of list functions.
- It is important to keep my code organized and follow industry standards of adding comments to make my program maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
